Description: This application is suppposed to be a place to see in each Finnkino theater that what movies are playing and at what time. It's a simple tool to help users find a movie to watch next and to know where and when to watch it.

Evaluation: I'm hoping, once again, that the application is satisfactory. I'd say it could be evaluated as good (20 points) or maybe even very good (25 points). I tried my best to make sure that all the requirements are fullfilled with this application.
